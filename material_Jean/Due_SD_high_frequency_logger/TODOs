- check all arrays for overflows
- check all printf
- simplify message logging logics: log part after part using several log_cstring commands (?)
- pre initialize all buffers with '\0'
- check all null bytes are well with backslash \ and not slash /

- extract classes from the FastLogger.cpp
- add compilation flags to the platformio.ini
- add switch to put on / off
- check all uses of printf, sprintf et co: risk to write at some strange places... replace by snprintf
- I2C logics: make resistant to sensor dying
- if cannot write to file too many times in a row, reset
- refactor / go again through the whole code
