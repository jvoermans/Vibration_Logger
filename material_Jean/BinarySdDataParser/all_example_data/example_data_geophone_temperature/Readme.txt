Measurements of geophone, incl. 4 temperature probes, and GPS fix.
Temperature probes can have variable temperature due to sun.

INA122 amplifier is gain of 5 by default. 4th and 5th amplifier give vertical vibrations at higher gain, i.e. 10 and 200.

Geophone was placed on wooden bench, arduino+battery on ground. Vibrations were generated through gentle ticks with finger nail at a distance of 3 m from geophone.

A0 --> X*5
A1 --> Y*5
A2 --> Z*5
A3 --> Z*10
A4 --> Z*200
